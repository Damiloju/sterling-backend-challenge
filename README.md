# Software Developer Application Test

Create an API that serves the latest scores of fixtures of matches in a “**Mock Premier League**”

## User Types

There should be:

- **Admin accounts** which are used to
  - signup/login
  - manage teams (add, remove, edit, view)
  - create fixtures (add, remove, edit, view)
  - Generate unique links for fixture
- **Users accounts** who can
  - signup/login
  - view teams
  - view completed fixtures
  - view pending fixtures
  - robustly search fixtures/teams
- Only the search API should be availble to the public.

## Authentication and Session Management
1. Use redis as your session store.
3. Authentication and Authorization for admin and user accounts should be done using `Bearer token` and `JWT`.

## Tools/Stack

- NodeJs (JavaScript or TypeScript)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Docker
- POSTMAN
- Jest
- Express

## Tests

Unit tests are a must, submissions without tests will be ignored.

## Submission

1. Your API endpoints should be documented in POSTMAN.
2. Seed the db with lots of data before final submission.
3. Code should be hosted on a git repository, Github preferably.
4. The API should be hosted on a live server (e.g. https://heroku.com)

## Bonus

You'll get bonus points for:
1. `containerization` using `docker`.
2. Thorough documentation using POSTMAN.
3. e2e tests and use of `Jest` for tests.
4. `web caching` API endpoints using `Redis`.
5. Implementing `rate limiting` for user account API access.

## Time Duration
